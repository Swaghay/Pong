# Pong

This is the final app that I made in MIT app inventor. This is a reimagining of the "original" videogame Pong but it is single-player and has a lot of extra features. This app sums up everything that I learned in AP Computer Science Principals. It includes all of the fundamentals of programming from data values to complex algorithms.
